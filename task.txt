we are designing an restful api -JSON
Best practices of restful api is  
    ->follow the client server architecture
    ->respect the http methods(get , post,put ,patch, delete,)


what are the task we are going to perform

GET "/users" -> it will list all the users (SSR means server side rendered page)
GET "/api/users" -> it will list all the users(this will return the json response)

GET "/users/id -> it will fetch out the user detail of the respective id

POST "/users"  -> create the new user

PATCH "/users/id" -> update the details of the user

DELETE "/users/id" -> delete the user from the database


// its always good to create a hybrid server means it will render various kind of devices 

//Dynamic path 
GET "/users/id 
so id should be dynamic so we can use :id this will mark the id as dynmaic and we can pass any value in route

//now Exploring about the middle wares in express
/*  
    we can say these are the mid-mans which can do processing on the req 
        -> they can send it forward 
        -> or they can end the response.

    //we can have multiple middle wares in our codebase.
